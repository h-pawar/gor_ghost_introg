Characterising introgressed fragments 

6.0.skov.coverage # x:autosome coverage in introgressed material in skov hmm outliers

6.1.overlap.sstar.skov # overlap between the two methods & overlap expected of random genomic regions

6.2.proteincodingbp/scripts # protein coding content in putative introgressed regions & in random genomic regions 

6.3.pca/scripts # PCA of putative introgressed regions & of random genomic regions

6.4.longesthaplotypes/scripts # haplotype networks of longest putative introgressed regions

6.5.NJtrees/scripts # NJ trees of putative introgressed regions & of random genomic regions

6.6.introgdeserts/scripts # regions depleted of introgressed material

6.7.pairwisebpdiff/scripts # pairwise base pair differences in putative introgressed regions across all gorilla individuals
