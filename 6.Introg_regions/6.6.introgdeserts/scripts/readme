# summary of steps in analysis of regions depleted for signatures of introgression

# 1) generates non-overlapping 1Mb windows per chr 'bins', filter out bins overlapping centromeres, only retain bins of length 1Mb
# 2) overlap bins with the putative introgressed fragments (determined as the overlap of s*-skov methods) per individual
# 3) counts frequency of an introgressed fragment within a bin 
# 4) take bins with no introgressed fragments as initial 'depleted' set - save(reduced_deserts,file="/scratch/devel/hpawar/admix/overlap.s*.skov/deserts/reduced.deserts.23aug22")

# 5) assess length distribution of 'depleted' set
# 6) take sums of Mb covered by 'depleted' regions >=5Mb, >=8Mb, & how much of each chr they cover

# assess data coverage of the 'depleted' set
test.datacov.depleted.8sep22.R
# 1) write out callable proportion for each 40kb window (info on which windows are informative) 
# 2) annotate the initial 'depleted' set with callable proportion info -> ie for each 'depleted' region - which 40kb windows are overlapping & what are their callable proportions? take the mean of these callable proportions to have a single value for each 'depleted' region
# 3) filter initial 'depleted' set by mean callable proportion > 0.5
# 4) take sums of Mb covered by 'depleted' regions >=5Mb, >=8Mb, & how much of each chr they cover # much fewer than previously obtained
127 Mb of depleted regions >= 5Mb (vs  601 Mb >= 5Mb when not taking data coverage into account)
